  BSA Advancement list -- For getting all new scouts to 1st
                  Class in less than 1 year.

Please note -- Although these things are in numeric order, they do not
have to be done in the order I have placed them.  I encourage the
changing of ideas of how to complete the requirements.  If you can think
of a better way to complete the requirement, use it and let me know about
it so I can update this list.

     lashings can be taught to them.  If time allows, do the
     exercises for T9a.  To cover the camp gadget
     requirement, have scouts use the lashings to make a
     chin-up bar.  Also show the scout the poisonous and
     regular local plants --Poison Ivy is a must.  For the
     poisonous plants, tell how to treat for exposure.  If
