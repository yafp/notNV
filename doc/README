About:
######
notNV[1] is a small and simple application to create & search notes - inspired by Notational Velocity[2]

The project is based on Qt[3] and focused on Linux as main platform,
while Apple & Microsoft operating systems "might" be supported as well in the future in case someone cares and wants to participate.

Check the wiki[4] for more informations or consider the doc folder delivered with each download.

In case you don't use github - feel free to contact me via email[5]
